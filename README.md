Problem: 
I have 25k photos and videos which include various file format(like .json, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, mov, .mp4, .pdf).
I want to delete the .json files and arrange video and photos in structure(my photos and video includes Screenrecorder, Screenshot, Snapchat/Photos, Snapchat/Video, PDF, GIF, Quotes, Collage, etc).
